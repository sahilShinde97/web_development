   /* 
   1. code that runs multiple times based on a condition
   2. Loops also alter the flow of execution, similar to function 
      *Function : Reusable blocks of code.
      *Loops : Repeated execution of code.
   3. Loops automate repetitive task
   4. Types of loops : for ,while ,do While
   5. Iterations : number of times runs

     syntax : While loop 

     while(condition)
     {
      //body of the loop 
     }  

     1. iterations : Number of times the loop runs.
     2. Used for non-standard condition.
     3. Repeating a block of code while a condition is true.
     4. Remember : Always include an update to avoid infinite loops. 

      syntax : for loop
